# Would You Rather project

This is my work on the Would You Rather Project as a part of the Udacity React Nanodegree Course. The design for this was built from scratch, this is my first time designing with css.

It is available on [Github Pages](https://ahmed-dardery.github.io/react-would-you-rather) if you want to test it out!
## Development

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`

## Building

To build a static version of the project use `yarn build`

## Deployment

To deploy this project, configure `package.json` `homepage` to your github page and run `yarn deploy`. If you deploy to another location you will need to configure `deploy` accordingly.
